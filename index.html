	  <h3>HISTORY</h3>
      <p class="history">Tartan was originally woven in wool coloured using natural dyes, traditional tartans have since been separated into ‘ancient’, ‘muted’ and ‘modern’, to distinguish between the palettes. Ancient tartans come in colours that could be created from natural dyes, whereas modern designs come in more variations due to chemical dying, and muted sits somewhere in between. Contrary to popular belief, tartan is in fact not solely a Scottish export. Dating back thousands of years to 3rd century China and found woven through the tapestry of Europe’s history, the common misconception that each pattern is attributed to a clan of Highland warriors is one born from large-scale commercial weavers in the 18th century, who named each of their patterns after towns nearby.<br><br>Overall, it was a convenient sales pitch the world fell for hook, line and sinker; a sentimental take on Scottish pride and local loyalty. It wasn’t until Queen Victoria began a love affair with Scotland that tartan came into the wider public’s consciousness. In Lytton Strachey’s biography of the Queen, he describes how her husband’s affection for tartan was apparent at Balmoral castle, in which they bought and decorated in 1848; “there were tartan curtains, and tartan chair-covers, and even tartan linoleums".<br><br><strong>Image:</strong> 'An Incident in the Rebellion of 1745' by David Morier (1705-1770). The eight featured highlanders in the painting wear over twenty different tartans.</p>

        <h3>THE 1970/80s</h3>
        <p class="seventies">Having been popularised by the Royal Family, tartan had become synonymous with society’s upper classes, and the misconceived idea that one must belong to a clan in order to authentically wear it was common. As well as its aristocratic background, tartan had always come with a set of rules - nobody, for example, may wear the Royal Stewart tartan without the express permission of the Queen. But, as with most rules, these were begging to be broken, and the seventies served up the perfect excuse to do so. The adoption of tartan by punks at the time was just one of their ways of sticking a middle finger to the upper crust.<br><br>Furthermore, they had their own monarch, punk princess Vivienne Westwood, and punk-rock bands like The Clash and The Sex Pistols. Johnny Rotten, with his shock of red hair and permanently startled expression, would take to the stage in clashing tartans and safety-pinned leather. Douglas Cordeaux, Managing Director of British clothmaker Fox Brothers, calls him “the original influencer”, his tartan ‘bondage’ kilt a key moment in style history. Controversy, nonconformity and an anti-establishment attitude became intrinsically linked to the textile.<br><br><strong>Video:</strong> Punk Culture during the 1970s - 1980s (i-D Vice).</p>

      <h3>THE 1990s</h3>
      <p class="nineties">The 1990s too, proved a pivotal decade for Tartan. Movies from The Heathers to St. Elmo's Fire had tartan in a preppy stronghold, and public figures including Princess Diana exhibited the fabric's more pristine potential. But meanwhile, the grunge movement was starting to take form in the Pacific Northwest.<br><br>The Tartan flannel shirt became the unofficial symbol of the grunge movement in the early 1990s. Bands like Nirvana, The Breeders, and Pearl Jam rocked tartan in their signature, grungy fashion. Prominent figures such as Kurt Cobain could often be seen wearing tartan open front shirts.<br><br>Despite tartans counterculture reputation, the mainstream seemed determined to make tartan both mainstream and idiosyncratic, culminating with Cher's style in 1995's Clueless. Empire Records followed soon after, and Liv Tyler's mini tartan skirt and fuzzy blue sweater became an iconic image.<br>In 1995, designer Alexander McQueen took up Westwood's gauntlet by infusing his collection with tartan, naming the collection "Highland Rape" in reference to Scotland's mistreatment by the English in the 1800s.<br><br><strong>Video:</strong> Alicia Silverstone in <i>Clueless</i> (1995) wearing her iconic yellow tartan outift.</p>

	  <h3>THE 2000/2010s</h3>
      <p class="noughties">During the first decade of the 2000s, many fashion trends since 1995 have continued to persist. Such examples include padded tartan lumberjack type shirts were also worn as part of winter type out-fits. During the latter period of the 2000s roll sleeve tartan flannel shirts were also popularized and were often worn in combination with white t-shirts, cardigans and V-neck sweaters.<br><br>In the fashion world, Tartan was, and is, still very much a pertinent pattern, taking the runway by storm at Gucci men's spring summer show in Milan 2011. Gucci presented a dazzling array of outfit samples featuring plaid suits, black and white tartan trousers with a white shirt and bow tie and of course the women’s collection which featured clashes of paprika, jade and rich amethyst.<br><br>Usually associated with preppy, punk or grunge fashion, tartan is perhaps one of the most versatile patterns out there. At Paris Fashion Week, designers turned to tartan for their Fall/Winter 2019 collections, presenting different variants of the print, ranging from hefty buffalo check to exaggerated glen plaid. Christian Dior and Marine Serre especially championed the print in their collections, while it made not-to-be-missed cameos at Lanvin, Unravel, and Rokh, too.<br><br><strong>Video:</strong> Tartan dominates at the Christian Dior Autumn-Winter 20187/19 Ready-to-Wear show.</p>

      <h3>2020s Onwards ...</h3>
      <p class="twenties">Tartan’s longevity may partly be down to its surrounding myths that surround it such as the dominant use of red as a result of warriors in battle wanting to disguise bloodshed. Its appropriation by punk and grunge culture propelled it from an eccentric textile to a fashion-forward design feature today. The variations are abundant and flexible; if florals feel too feminine, stripes too boring, spots too kitsch, tartan is neither masculine nor feminine, neither youthful or mature. Whether it’s a classic flannel shirt, the lining of a Burberry trench or a Baracuta jacket , everyone – can wear it their own way. Scottish tweed specialist Paul Walker explains the allure; “Tartan is a tribal fabric, so it will always attract designers to use it and customers to buy. Ralph Lauren was one of the first designers to tap into this, channelling his brand’s strong identity.<br><br>For some time, Black Watch tartan stood in the shadow of its louder brother, Royal Stewart. But in recent years has come into its own. Once reserved for the regiment after which it’s named, its look makes it an effortless addition to the wardrobe. “It’s so wearable,” Walker says. “It’s masculine and links to that unity of a regiment again – it’s an easy entry into tartan before your confident to embrace full colour”. Far from its roots in the Scottish Highlands, via a stint on the cutting edge of fashion and culture, tartan now delivers a considered approach to pattern. Subtle, neutral colourways make it a versatile suiting fabric, especially in muted tones of black and green, and is more apparent in luxury designers’ collections and high street brands. If tartan continues on its current trajectory, we’ll be seeing it on the streets for a while.<br><br><strong>Video:</strong> Johnstons of Elgin - AW18/19 New Tradition - Womenswear.</p>
